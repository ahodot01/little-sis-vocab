# Little Sister's Vocabulary
This code is a solution to the task with following instructions:
You are helping your younger sister with her English vocabulary homework, which she is 
finding very tedious. Her class is learning to create new words by adding prefixes and 
suffixes. Given a set of words, the teacher is looking for correctly transformed words 
with correct spelling by adding the prefix to the beginning or the suffix to the ending.
There's four activities in the assignment, each with a set of text or words to work with:
- 1. Add a prefix to a word: happy > unhappy.
- 2. Add prefixes to word groups: same as #1, but with group (list).
- 3. Remove a suffix from a word: happines > happy.
- 4. Extract and transform a word: bright > brigthen.
